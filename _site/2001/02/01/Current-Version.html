<h2 id='about_javascript'>About JavaScript</h2>

<p>JavaScript (sometimes shortened to JS) is a lightweight, interpreted, object-oriented language with first-class functions, most known as the scripting language for Web pages, but used in many non-browser environments as well such as <a href='http://nodejs.org/'>node.js</a>.</p>

<h2 id='current_version'>Current version</h2>

<p>The JavaScript standard is ECMAScript. As of 2012, all modern browsers fully support ECMAScript 5.1. Older browsers support at least ECMAScript 3. A 6th major revision of the standard is being worked on.</p>
