<h3>컨벤션 (코드 작성 규칙)</h3>

<p>
    As every language, JavaScript has many code style guides. Maybe the most used and recommended is the <a target="_blank" href="http://google-styleguide.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/javascriptguide.xml">Google Code Style Guide for JavaScript</a>, but we recommend you read <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/rwldrn/idiomatic.js/">Idiomatic.js</a>.
</p>

<h3>린팅 (코딩 스타일 검사)</h3>

<p>
    Nowadays the best tool for linting your JavaScript code is <a target="_blank" href="http://www.jshint.com/">JSHint</a>. We recommend that whenever possible you verify your code style and patterns with a Lint tool.
