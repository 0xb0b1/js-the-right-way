# Welcome

There's a lot of obsolete and wrong information about JavaScript on the web. This makes new developers be afraid on moving into the language, and the web a worst place to be, since JavaScript is the most popular web language nowadays.

## Disclaimer

It's important to know that JavaScript has some bad parts, but also have nice ones! And that nice parts make it worth. It's a fun language to work with, and if you know how to use it in the "right way", you can enjoy programming on it.

We also ensure that there's no really "right way" to work with JavaScript. There's many ways, and this makes each programmer and each language unique. Here we just introduce new JavaScript developers and also experienced ones to follow best practices and get references, such as follow the creators and big names of JavaScript community.

This is a living document and will continue to be updated with more helpful information and examples as they become available.
