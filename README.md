## Note

As you might have seen, the code in this repository makes reference to the old website. The new one, is still only html, and I need help to port it to Docpad or some other tool to make it easy for other people to contribute. 
So, if you have knowledge to make it happen, please fork this project and checkout the `latest` branch. There you'll see the website on [JSTRW](http://jstherightway.com). Feel free to contact me if you need anything `sudowilliam@gmail.com`.

Thanks, and let's continue to improve this guide and provide the best resources to the JavaScript community!

## Where

<http://www.jstherightway.org>

## Why?

Today we have a bunch of websites running JavaScript. I think we need a place to put all the best practices and references together so we can share this (good) information and help to keep the web more organized.

## Who

My name is [William Oliveira](http://github.com/gnuwilliam). I'm contributor of many open source projects, and also a Freelance Developer.
