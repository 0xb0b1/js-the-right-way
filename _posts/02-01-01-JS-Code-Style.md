# JS Code Style!

Like every language, JavaScript has many code style guides. Maybe the most used and recommended is the [Google Code Style Guide for JavaScript][1], but we recommend you read the [Idiomatic.js][2].

Nowadays the best tool for linting your JS code is the [JSHint][3]. We recommend that whenever possible you verify your code style with a Lint tool.
