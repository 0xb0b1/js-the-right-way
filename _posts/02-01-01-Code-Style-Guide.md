# Code Style Guide

The JavaScript community is large and diverse, composed of innumerable libraries, frameworks, and components. It is common for JavaScript developers to choose several of these and combine them into a single project. It is important that JavaScript code adhere (as close as possible) to a common code style to make it easy for developers to mix and match various libraries for their projects.

As any language, JavaScript has many code style guides, but the most used and recommended is the [Google Code Style Guide for JavaScript][1].
